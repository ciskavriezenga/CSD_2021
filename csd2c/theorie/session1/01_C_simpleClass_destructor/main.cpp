/*
 * This example contains a class with a defined deconstructor.
 *
 * Constructors and destructors are special function members of a class.
 * A constructor is called when an object is created.
 * A destructor is called when an object is destoryed.
 *
 * If a class definition does not contain a deconstructor definition, an implicit
 * deconstructor is used by default.
 *
 * ------ HANDS-ON TIPS ------
 * â€¢ Look at the text printed to the console, when is the destructor called?
