CPP installation help for Windows users.

For some ease of use with compiling in Windows it is recommended to use one of the following compilation methods:
Mingw32:
https://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/

In all tutorials Mingw32 has been used as a host for our files in cpp. Mingw32 does not support Posix, 
so in case you would like to use multithreading I would recommend to install Cygwin right away:
https://cygwin.com/install.html

Or msys:
https://www.msys2.org/

For the Mingw32 installation there is this great tutorial to guide you through the installation process:

Any specific additions and instructions are to be found in the readme in each specific folder.
